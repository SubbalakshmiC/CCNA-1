# ICND1

In ICND 1 we will do:
* Describe network fundamentals and implement a simple LAN
* Establish internet connectivity
* Expand a small network to a medium sized now with routing enabled
* Configure, manage, secure and monitor Cisco devices
* Describe IPV6 basics

> CEF Cisco express forwarding will be in the routing section maybe....

## Module 1 - building a simple network

### Exploring the functions of a network

a network allows people access to information. for example allows you to access emails, internet and so on. allows you to connect multiple sights together, like all the Cisco offices. Supports mobile users and allows them to do their work when they are not actually in the workplace. Could be private or public, 

#### physical components of a network

  * Firewall
  	* filters the traffic to only allow what you want / what it good
	* filters from outside in, the outgoing is not normally filtered 
  * Endpoints
  	* The end user machines - IP phones - laptops - desktops and so on
	* can connect with either wire or wireless 
  * Interconnections
  	* Network media
		* ethernet cable
			* can be UTP (Unsheilded twisted pair)
			* different cat levels, cat 1 - 6 or so
		* or fibre optic
			* simple = small glass inside
			* multi mode = bigger
			* immune to interference 
			* used for when over long distance (100m - km's)
			* split in two, one for send one for reiceive 
		* or coaxial
			* sinple copper core, used for internet in street
	* connectors
		* ethernet 
			* (R)egistered (J)ack
			* RJ45 - the one that is used all of the time
			* RJ11 - the old phone one
		* fibre
			* subscriber - SC
			* lucid - LC
			* stright tip - ST(C)
		* NIC (Network interface card)
			* used to allow the computer to actually plug into and use the network and connecter
  * Switches
  	* allows local devices to talk to each other
	* has many NIC interface
	* allow different parts of the building to speak with each other as they connect a small geographical location
  * Routers
  * WLAN devices
  * AP's
  * WLAN controller
  * Firewall
