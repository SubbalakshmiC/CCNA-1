# CCNA Revision Document
CCNA lasts 3 years - can take a higher exam to requalify for CCNA

Boot camp begins!

* 4 week course
* 2 weeks of ICND1
* 1 week to study
* Then there is the part 1 exam
* Then 2 weeks of ICND2

## ICND1
* 90 mins - 55 to 60 questions
* Exam is tight for time
* Cannot go back, answer right first time
* If you fail you wait a week before you pass
* 826 out of 1000 to pass - 300 for turning up
* 4 or 5 questions wrong to fail
* Get told straight or away pass or fail

### Goals - 2 weeks
* Describe network fundamentals and implement a simple LAN
* Establish Internet connectivity
* Expand a small network to a medium sized network with routing enabled (CEF - Cisco Express Forwarding)
* Configure, manage, secure and monitor Cisco devices
* Describe IPV6 basics

### Module 1 - Building a simple network

#### Exploring the functions of a network
A network allows a connection of one thing to another.
Could be a one person to another (bus network etc) or more examples.
Allows the connection of multiple sites (places).
Also allows the connection of mobile workers or working from home.
Networks could be private (such as in a home or office) or a public network (such as the ones supplied by BT etc.).
Use to connect a selection of end devices to other end devices (PC's, IP Phones Servers, Printers etc.) or network equipment (WAP, Router, Switch etc.).

##### Network Components
* Firewall - Monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic
* Endpoints - PC's etc
* Interconnections - Used to connect devices together
	* NIC - Translate computer data into a format that can be sent over the network
	* Network Media - Transmits signals from one device to another
		* Cables - The physical wires 
			* UTP (Unsheilded Twisted Pair) - Used for short distances
				* Includes different CATegories
				* E.G. Cat 6
			* Fibre Optic - Immune to interference, Used for long distance
				* Single mode fibre
				* Multi mode fibre 
			* Coaxial
			* etc (All of the cables)
		* Wireless
	* Connectors for Network Media - The plugs on the end of cables
		* RJ45
		* Fibre Connectors (IDK what they are called)
		* etc (All of the plugs) 
* Switches - Devices that endpoints typically connect to
* Routers - Used to connect networks, does the 'routing' between networks
* WLAN Controller - Used to do administrattion on multiple AP's
* AP's - 
* WLAN Devices
* Firewalls



### Module 2 - Establishing Internet Connectivity

### Module 3 - Summary Challenge

### Module 4 - Building a Medium Sized Network

### Module 5 - Network Device management and Security

### Module 6 - Summary Challenge

### Module 7 - Introducing IPV6
